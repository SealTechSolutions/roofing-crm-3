## Active backlog
- **P1 — Commission Module** (spec at `/app/memory/COMMISSION_PRD.md`): blocked on user confirmation of flat % vs tiered, refund reversals, signature flow.
- **P1 — WSC Fork Strategy**: branding-constants refactor → `branding.py` first, then decide fork vs multi-tenant tag.
- **P2 — Timeline View & Photo Reorganization**: desktop drag-and-drop photo reorder.
- **P2 — server.py refactor**: split >7,200-line `server.py` into `/app/backend/routes/`.
- **P3 — Mobile-only PWA Views**: `/field/today`, `/field/calendar`, `/field/recent-photos`.
- **P3 — Stripe**: blocked on user's bank + Stripe keys.

## Architecture
- Backend: FastAPI + Motor MongoDB + ReportLab. Key modules: `server.py`, `product_catalog.py`, `spec_sheet.py`, `work_orders.py`, `proposal_signing.py`, `email_routing.py`, `email_sender.py`.
- Frontend: React + Tailwind + Shadcn. Key pages: `Calculator.jsx`, `Library.jsx`, `WorkOrderSign.jsx`, `DealDetail.jsx`, `ProposalSign.jsx`.
- Integrations: Gmail SMTP (user creds), Google Calendar (user creds), Emergent Object Storage (Universal LLM Key).

## Key collections
- `deals` — proposed_roof_type, stage, subcontractor_accepted, scope_overrides, proposal_option_1, warranty_20yr_add, assigned_to_user_id, calc_custom_addons.
- `calculator_settings` — singleton: markup_pct, handling_pct (12), overhead_pct (30), profit_pct, shipping_pct (20).
- `library_files`, `work_order_drafts`.

## Refactor debt
- `/app/backend/server.py` > 7,200 lines — split into route modules.
- Brand constants (company name, email, phone, logo) scattered across PDF generators — consolidate into `branding.py`.

## Testing notes
- ALWAYS use `TEST_` prefixed dummy deals when invoking `testing_agent_v3_fork`. Never touch real user data.
- Admin: `darren@sealtechsolutions.co` / `admin123` (see `/app/memory/test_credentials.md`).
